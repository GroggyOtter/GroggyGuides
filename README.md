# GroggyGuides
The new home for my "GroggyGuides".  

This will be a place to find "GroggyGuides" written about multiple different things (mainly relating to AHK but I may expand!)  

GroggyGuides are guides that try to break down a topic in a way people can understand.  
I want them to be the meeting ground between technical and layman.  

They may be a bit longer, but that's me trying to ensure the concepts and knowledge is understood, not just read.
